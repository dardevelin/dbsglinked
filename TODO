# TODO LIST

--------------- changes made in version 0.0.3
DONE: - modify libglinked_create_node to not allocate or copy data to node->data.
  the function will just simply point node->data to the data passed by the user,
  this way is up to the user to handle the data.
---------------

--------------- added in version 0.0.2
DONE: - Modify libglinked_delete_node and libglinked_delete_list to use a 
  user define function to delete the node data 
---------------

- maybe implemente a macro to make a copy and create a node at the same time

- Perphaps add macros to allow references list, this means that elements that are
  already in the program(e.g string literals, const, or static
  could be added to the list without having to copy them if the user doesn't need
  to alter them.

- Try make deb package for debian

- See if the code needs more comments
  
- Implement search and friends, 

{
- maybe add an Identifier to the items, this way a user could define types and use the list
  as a really generic type one.
 
- if the previous mentioned features gets in, 
	* implement sort, by key/identifier/type
	* implement remove function for specific elements
        * insert elements according to key/id/type rules
        * ways to define rules
}
