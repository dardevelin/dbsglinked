# TODO LIST

--------------- changes made in version 0.0.3
DONE: - modify libglinked_create_node to not allocate or copy data to node->data.
  the function will just simply point node->data to the data passed by the user,
  this way is up to the user to handle the data.

--------------- added in version 0.0.2
DONE: - Modify libglinked_delete_node and libglinked_delete_list to use a 
  user define function to delete the node data 
---------------

	* implement sort, by key/identifier/type

        * insert elements according to key/id/type rules
