# TODO LIST

--------------- changes made in version 0.0.3
DONE: - modify libglinked_create_node to not allocate or copy data to node->data.
  the function will just simply point node->data to the data passed by the user,
  this way is up to the user to handle the data.
---------------

--------------- added in version 0.0.2
DONE: - Modify libglinked_delete_node and libglinked_delete_list to use a 
  user define function to delete the node data 
---------------

- Add to libglinked_list_t function pointer for an allocator and a deallocator
  this should make easy to integrate the list into projects that
  use a custom (de)allocator. these functions will be used to create and delete 
  libglinked_node_t structures

- add function to set libglinked_list_t function pointers.

- update libglinked_create_node to receive the list since the list contains
  the allocator and deallocator of the node structure

- update libglinked_delete_node and libglinked_delete_list
  to not require a deallocator for data

- Try make deb package for debian

- See if the code needs more comments
  
- Implement search and friends, 

{
- maybe add an Identifier to the items, this way a user could define types and use the list
  as a really generic type one.
 
- if the previous mentioned features gets in, 
	* implement sort, by key/identifier/type
	* implement remove function for specific elements
        * insert elements according to key/id/type rules
        * ways to define rules
}
