# TODO LIST
- Modify libglinked_delete_node and libglinked_delete_list to use a 
  user define function to delete the node data

- Perphaps add macros to allow references list, this means that elements that are
  already in the program(e.g string literals, const, or static
  could be added to the list without having to copy them if the user doesn't need
  to alter them.

- Try make deb package for debian

- See if the code needs more comments
